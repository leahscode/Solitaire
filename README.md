# Solitaire

Completed in one free afternoon, this Java Solitaire game is played from the command line. My web-development professor, who taught Java for another group, suggested that I try it, just for fun. It demonstrates the use of classes, overloading, and other Java goodies. The game rules are delineated in the PDF.
